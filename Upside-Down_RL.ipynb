    "While there is a rich history of techniques that incorporate supervised learning (SL) into reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, it is believed that fully solving RL problems using SL is not possible, because feedback from the environment provides error signals in SL but evaluation signals in RL. Put simply, an agent gets feedback about how useful its actions are, but not about which actions are the best to take in any situation. On the possibility of turning an RL problem into an SL problem, Barto and Dietterich surmised: _\"In general, there is no way to do this.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "In a companion technical report, Schmidhuber proposes to bridge this gap between SL and RL through UpsideDown Reinforcement Learning (⅂ꓤ), where environmental feedback – such as the reward – is an input rather than the learning target as in traditional RL algorithms based on reward prediction. Here we develop a practical RL algorithm for episodic tasks and show that it is indeed possible to train agents in general model-free settings without using value-based algorithms such as Q-learning, or policy-based ones such as policy gradients and evolutionary algorithms. Instead, RL uses pure SL to train an agent on all past experiences, and sidesteps the issues arising from the combination of function approximation, bootstrapping and off-policy training. We first describe its basic principles, then experimentally demonstrate its practical feasibility on three RL problems with both sparse and dense reward structure."

    "Traditional model-free RL algorithms can be broadly classified as being value-based or policy-based. The core principle of value-based algorithms is reward prediction: agents are trained to predict the expected discounted future return for taking any action in any state, commonly using TD learning. Policy-based algorithms are instead based on directly searching for policies that maximize returns. The basic principle of ⅂ꓤ are different from both of these categories: given a particular definition of _commands_, it defines a _behavior function_ that encapsulates knowledge about the behaviors observed so far compatible with known commands. The nature of the behavior function is explained using two examples below."

    "Consider a simple dart-throwing environment where each episode lasts a single step. An agent learning to throw darts receives a return inversely proportional to the hit distance from the center of the board. In each episode, the agent observes the initial state of the dart, and takes an action that determines the force and direction of the throw. Using value-based RL for this task would amount to training the agent to predict the expected return for various actions and initial states. This knowledge would then be used for action selection e.g. taking the action with the highest expected return.\n",

The dart throwing agent would be trained to directly produce the actions for hitting desired locations on the board, using a behavior function B<sup>2</sup> learned using its past experience. Figure 1 schematically illustrates this difference between B and the Q-value function commonly used in value based RL. Since this environment consists of episodes with a single time step, both Q and B can be learned using SL. \n",

Additionally consider commands of the type: achieve a given desired return in a given desired horizon from the current state. A behavior function based on the set of all unique behaviors possible in this environment can then be expressed in a tabular form in Table 1. It maps states and commands to the action to be taken in that state compatible with executing the command. In other words, it answers the question: _\"if an agent is in a given state and desires a given return over a given horizon, which action should it take next?\"_ By design, this function can now be used to execute any valid command in the environment without further knowledge.\n",

First, the output of B can be stochastic even in a deterministic environment since there may be multiple valid behaviors compatible with the same command and state.

    "In principle, a behavior function can be learned for any policy that generates all possible trajectories in an environment given suficient time (e.g. a random policy) and then used to select actions that lead to any desired return in a desired horizon achievable in the environment. But such a learning procedure is not practical since it relies on undirected exploration using a fixed policy. Moreover, in environments with scalar rewards, the goal is to learn to achieve high returns and not to achieve any possible return over any horizon. Therefore, the concrete algorithm used in this paper trains a behavior function on the set of trajectories (or the agent’s experience) so far and incorporates minimal additions that enable the continual collection of trajectories with higher returns."

    "High-level pseudo-code for the proposed algorithm is described in Algorithm 1. It starts by initializing an empty replay buffer to collect the agent’s experiences during training, and filling it with a few episodes of random interactions. The behavior function of the agent is continually improved by supervised training on previous experiences recorded in the replay buffer. After each training phase, the behavior function is used to act in the environment to obtain new experiences that are added to the replay buffer. This procedure continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching the allowed maximum number of interactions with the environment. The remainder of this section describes each step of the algorithm and introduces the hyperparameters."

    "As described earlier, at any time t during an episode, the current behavior function B produces an action distribution in response to the current state st and command c<sub>t</sub> = (d<sup>r</sup><sub>t</sub>, d<sup>h</sup><sub>t</sub>), where d<sup>r</sup><sub>t</sub> ∈ R is the desired return and d<sup>h</sup><sub>t</sub> ∈ N is the desired time horizon at time t. The predicted action distribution _P_(a<sub>t</sub> | s<sub>t</sub>, c<sub>t</sub>) = _B_(s<sub>t</sub>, c<sub>t</sub>; θ), where θ denotes a vector of trainable parameters, is expected to lead to successful execution of the command ct interpreted as: “achieve a return d<sup>r</sup><sub>t</sub> during the next d<sup>h</sup><sub>t</sub> steps”. For a given initial command input c<sub>0</sub>, _B_ can be used to generate a trajectory using Algorithm 2 by sampling actions predicted for the current command and updating the command according to the obtained rewards and elapsed time.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important implementation detail is that d<sup>h</sup><sub>t</sub> is always set to max(d<sup>h</sup><sub>t</sub>, 1) such that it is a valid time horizon. Furthermore, d<sup>r</sup><sub>t</sub> is clipped such that it is upper-bounded by the maximum return achievable in the environment. This only affects agent evaluations (not training) and avoids situations where negative rewards (rt) can lead to desired returns that are not achievable from any state (see Algorithm 2; line 8).\n",
    "\n",
    "All agents were implemented using articial neural networks. The behavior function for UDRL agents was implemented using fully-connected feed-forward networks for LunarLander-v2, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs; 16) for TakeCover-v0. The command inputs were scaled by a fixed scaling factor, transformed by a fully-connected sigmoidal layer, and then multiplied element-wise with an embedding of the observed inputs (after the first layer for fully-connected networks; after all convolutional layers for CNNs). Apart from this small modification regarding UDRL command inputs, the network architectures were identical for all algorithms."
