    "While there is a rich history of techniques that incorporate supervised learning (SL) into reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, it is believed that fully solving RL problems using SL is not possible, because feedback from the environment provides error signals in SL but evaluation signals in RL. Put simply, an agent gets feedback about how useful its actions are, but not about which actions are the best to take in any situation. On the possibility of turning an RL problem into an SL problem, Barto and Dietterich surmised: _\"In general, there is no way to do this.\"_\n",
    "\n",
    "In a companion technical report, Schmidhuber proposes to bridge this gap between SL and RL through UpsideDown Reinforcement Learning (⅂ꓤ), where environmental feedback – such as the reward – is an input rather than the learning target as in traditional RL algorithms based on reward prediction. Here we develop a practical RL algorithm for episodic tasks and show that it is indeed possible to train agents in general model-free settings without using value-based algorithms such as Q-learning, or policy-based ones such as policy gradients and evolutionary algorithms. Instead, RL uses pure SL to train an agent on all past experiences, and sidesteps the issues arising from the combination of function approximation, bootstrapping and off-policy training. We first describe its basic principles, then experimentally demonstrate its practical feasibility on three RL problems with both sparse and dense reward structure."

    "Traditional model-free RL algorithms can be broadly classified as being value-based or policy-based. The core principle of value-based algorithms is reward prediction: agents are trained to predict the expected discounted future return for taking any action in any state, commonly using TD learning. Policy-based algorithms are instead based on directly searching for policies that maximize returns. The basic principle of ⅂ꓤ are different from both of these categories: given a particular definition of _commands_, it defines a _behavior function_ that encapsulates knowledge about the behaviors observed so far compatible with known commands. The nature of the behavior function is explained using two examples below."

    "Consider a simple dart-throwing environment where each episode lasts a single step. An agent learning to throw darts receives a return inversely proportional to the hit distance from the center of the board. In each episode, the agent observes the initial state of the dart, and takes an action that determines the force and direction of the throw. Using value-based RL for this task would amount to training the agent to predict the expected return for various actions and initial states. This knowledge would then be used for action selection e.g. taking the action with the highest expected return.\n",

The dart throwing agent would be trained to directly produce the actions for hitting desired locations on the board, using a behavior function B<sup>2</sup> learned using its past experience. Figure 1 schematically illustrates this difference between B and the Q-value function commonly used in value based RL.

Additionally consider commands of the type: achieve a given desired return in a given desired horizon from the current state. A behavior function based on the set of all unique behaviors possible in this environment can then be expressed in a tabular form in Table 1. It maps states and commands to the action to be taken in that state compatible with executing the command. In other words, it answers the question: _\"if an agent is in a given state and desires a given return over a given horizon, which action should it take next?\"_ By design, this function can now be used to execute any valid command in the environment without further knowledge.\n",

    "In principle, a behavior function can be learned for any policy that generates all possible trajectories in an environment given suficient time (e.g. a random policy) and then used to select actions that lead to any desired return in a desired horizon achievable in the environment. But such a learning procedure is not practical since it relies on undirected exploration using a fixed policy. Moreover, in environments with scalar rewards, the goal is to learn to achieve high returns and not to achieve any possible return over any horizon. Therefore, the concrete algorithm used in this paper trains a behavior function on the set of trajectories (or the agent’s experience) so far and incorporates minimal additions that enable the continual collection of trajectories with higher returns."

    "High-level pseudo-code for the proposed algorithm is described in Algorithm 1. It starts by initializing an empty replay buffer to collect the agent’s experiences during training, and filling it with a few episodes of random interactions. The behavior function of the agent is continually improved by supervised training on previous experiences recorded in the replay buffer. After each training phase, the behavior function is used to act in the environment to obtain new experiences that are added to the replay buffer. This procedure continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching the allowed maximum number of interactions with the environment. The remainder of this section describes each step of the algorithm and introduces the hyperparameters."

The maximum buffer size is a hyperparameter. Since the agent starts learning with zero experience, an initial set of trajectories is generated by executing random actions in the environment.

    "As discussed in Section 2.2, _B_ admits supervised training on a large amount of input-target examples from any past episode. The goal of training is to make the behavior function produce outputs consistent with all previously recorded trajectories in the replay buffer according to Equation 1. \n",

    "(s<sub>t1</sub>, (d<sup>r</sup>, d<sup>h</sup>)), where d<sup>r</sup> = ∑ r<sub>t</sub> and d<sup>h</sup> = t2 − t1, and the target is a<sub>t1</sub>, the action taken at t1. To summarize, the training examples are generated by selecting the time horizons, actions, observations and rewards in the past, and generating input-target pairs consistent with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several heuristics may be used to select and combine training examples into mini-batches for gradient-based SL. For\n",
    "all experiments in this paper, only \"trailing segments\" were sampled from each episode, i.e., we set t2 = T − 1 where\n",
    "T is the length of any episode. This discards a large amount of potential training examples but is a good fit for episodic tasks where the goal is to optimize the total reward until the end of each episode. It also makes training easier, since the behavior function only needs to learn to execute a subset of possible commands. To keep the setup simple, a fixed number of training iterations using Adam were performed in each training step for all experiments."
